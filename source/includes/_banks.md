# Bank Integrations Guide
## API access

TransferWise uses standard OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. 

Once we start our partnership  we will send you API access credentials for sandbox environment: api_client_id & api_client_secret.
You need these in order to request user authorizations so you can make payments on behalf of them.
We also need *redirect_url* from your technical team so that we can make the integration more secure by limiting our callbacks to only this URL. 

[OAuth 2.0: The Complete Guide](https://auth0.com/blog/oauth2-the-complete-guide/) is great guide to refresh your knowledge about the protocol itself.


### TEST and LIVE environments

* Sandbox API is located at https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech
* LIVE API is located at https://api.transferwise.com


## Customized user experience

You will be building user experience directly into your mobile and desktop applications and will be using TransferWise API only in the background. 
There are different ways to build the frontend experience, especially when it comes to the sequence of steps in the payment flow.

For example you can put sign up/login step as a first step and then show currency calculator and then collect recipient details.
Or you can start from calculator, then collect recipient details and as a last step ask user to login / signup.  

So this guide is more like a list of building blocks rather than a strict step-by-step guide.

We have a dedicated team focusing on bank partnerships who will be helping you to figure it out. 


## User on-boarding flow
User on-boarding flow consists of these building blocks.  
You need to go through this flow only once per each customer before they are setting up their first payment.

* [Get user authorization](#bank-integrations-guide-get-user-authorization)
* [Get user tokens](#bank-integrations-guide-get-user-tokens)
* [Create personal user profile](#bank-integrations-guide-create-personal-user-profile)
* [Create business user profile](#bank-integrations-guide-create-business-user-profile)


## Get user authorization

> Your app redirects user to Transferwise authorization webpage

```shell
https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<your api client id>&redirect_uri=https://www.yourbank.com
```

> Transferwise authorization page redirects user back to your redirect page.

```shell
https://www.yourbank.com/?code=[CODE]
```

### Your banking app redirects user to Transferwise authorization webpage

**`https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<your-api-client-id>&redirect_uri=https://www.yourbank.com`**

Replace *your-api-client-id* and *redirect_uri* with your specific values. 
The redirect URI should be the address you want the user to be returned to after the authorization flow. 

*Please note that URL for authorization page in sandbox is located at sandbox.transferwise.tech which is different than URL for API calls - api.sandbox.transferwise.tech. 
In live environment standard api.transferwise.com url works for authorization page as well as API calls.*


### User signs-up or logs in and authorizes your banking app to access their Transferwise account

Transferwise provides options for existing customers to login and new customers to sign-up first.

Initial sign-up is is just limited to creating a user entity and does not include going through KYC. New customers have 3 options to signup:

  <ul>
    <li>Providing email and password (email has to be unique)</li>
    <li>Connect with Facebook</li>
    <li>Connect with Google</li>
  </ul>


Users are then directed to authorization page where they can authorize your banking app to have access to their Transferwise account.

### Tranferwise redirects user back to your banking app

https://www.yourbank.com/?code=[CODE]

Once user gives your banking app authorization then user is redirected back to your *redirect_uri* with a generated code query string value. 
Your website or service can then use this code to obtain access token to act on behalf of the user account.

## Get user tokens

> Example Request:

```shell
curl \
-u '[your-api-client-id]:[your-api-client-secret]' \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
-d 'client_id=[your-api-client-id]' \
-d 'code=[CODE]' \
-d 'redirect_uri=https://www.yourbank.com' \
'https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/token' 
```

> Example Response:

```json
  {
    "access_token":"ba8k9935-62f2-475a-60d8-6g45377b4062",
    "token_type":"bearer",
    "refresh_token":"a235uu9c-9azu-4o28-a1kn-e15500o151cx",
    "expires_in": 43199,
    "scope":"transfers"
  }
```

As next step you need to obtain user tokens so you can call API endpoints on behalf of user who gave this authorized your banking app.
You need the *code* provided to you during authorization flow to get user's access_token and refresh_token.
For calling API endpoints you need to provide access_token in request header in the format "Authorization: Bearer access_token".
Access tokens are however valid only for 12 hours, so upon expiry you need to use refresh_token to generate new access_token.
This means you have to securely store user's refresh_token. 

### Request

**`POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v1/oauth/token`**

Use Basic Authentication with your api-client-id/api-client-secret as username/pwd.

Field                 | Description                                   | Format
---------             | -------                                       | -----------
grant_type            | "authorization_code"                          | Text

code                  | Code  provided to you upon redirect back from authorization flow. See previous step [Get user authorization](#bank-integrations-guide-get-user-authorization).  | Text
redirect_uri          | Redirect page associated with your api client credentials   | Text


### Response

Field                 | Description                                   | Format
---------             | -------                                       | -----------
access_token          | Access token to be used when calling API endpoints on behalf of user. Valid for 12 hours. | uuid
token_type            | "bearer"                                      | Text
refresh_token         | Refresh token which you need to use in order to request new access_token. The lifetime of refresh tokens is 10 years. | uuid
expires_in            | Expiry time in seconds                        | Integer
scope                 | "transfers"                                   | Text


## Refresh user access token

> Example Request:

```shell
      curl \
      'https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/token' \
      -u '[your-api-client-id]:[your-api-client-secret]' \
      -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
      -d 'refresh_token=[user's refresh token]'
```

> Example Response:

```json
  {
    "access_token":"be69d566-971e-4e15-9648-85a486195863",
    "token_type":"bearer",
    "refresh_token":"1d0ec7b9-b569-426d-a18d-8dead5b6a3cc",
    "expires_in":43199,
    "scope":"transfers"
  }
```

Access tokens are valid for 12 hours, so upon expiry you need to use refresh_token to generate new access_token. 

In order to maintain an uninterrupted connection, you can request a new access token whenever it is close to expiring.
There is no need to wait for the actual expiration to happen first. 

### Request

**`POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v1/oauth/token`**

## Signup new users via API

We encourage bank integrations to use sign-up functionality included in [Get user authorization](#bank-integrations-guide-get-user-authorization) flow. 

But there is also an alternative way to create new users to TransferWise platform by using [Signup with registration code](#users-sign-up-with-registration-code) feature.

This functionality enables you to create new users directly via back-end API call, without the need to redirect new users to Transferwise authorization page. This way new users can complete everything without ever leaving your banking app.
Existing Transferwise users still need to be redirected to authorization page flow.

Note that these new users have to accept TransferWise Terms and Conditions as part of their signup process nevertheless.  See endpoint [Terms and conditions](#terms-and-conditions-get-terms-and-conditions).


## Create personal user profile


Use  Get user profiles first !!!

For existing users - > get profiles first !?
The guide assumes you have already created user â€” see .

Using obtained user token.

Personal user profile should be created before creating a transfer.

If you will make business transfers, then personal profile is required to be filled in first as well, and business profile should be created afterwards.

There are two steps to create a personal profile:
- Create personal user profile - basic info.
- Add address to personal user profile.


Step 1. Create private customer  â€” basic info

POST /v1/profiles


{
    "type": "personal",
    "details" : {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Snow",
        "dateOfBirth": "1980-07-20",
        "phoneNumber": "+380964441122"
    }
}



Response
You should receive back a successful (200) response with a personal profile id along with other profile keys that have been successfully saved.


Step 2. Add address to personal user profile

Once basic profile information has been saved, you also need to add address information to personal user profile.
When saving address, you need to specify which profile you want to save address to. 
In profile key, provide a profile id of a personal profile that was returned in previous step response.

Request
POST /v1/addresses


{
    "profile" : 12345
    "details": {
        "country": "US",
        "state" : "NY",
        "city": "New York",
        "postCode": "10112",
        "firstLine": "Park Ave 4021"
    }
}

There is a guide #docTextSection:MEDFDFDMQrmJjtnHS that explains which data fields and validations are in place for addresses in different countries.

You should get back a successful (200) response with a personal profile address id along with other address keys that have been successfully saved.


3. Create identification document

Only for personal profiles.  which you created 



## Create business user profile

Prerequisite is that personal user profile has been created. To on-board businesses, also business user profile has to be created.

Similar two steps apply:

Create business user profile â€” basic info
Add address to business user profile


Step 3.1. Create business user profile â€” basic info

Request

POST /v1/profiles

{
    "type": "business",
    "details" : {
        "name": "The Business",
        "registrationNumber" : "12345",
        "descriptionOfBusiness" : "education_and_learning",
        "type" : "limited",
        "webpage": "http://business.com",
        "acn": "australian-specific. only include if australian business",
        "abn": "australian-specific. only include if australian business",
        "arbn": "australian-specific. only include if australian business"
    }
}



Response

You should receive back a successful (200) response with a business profile id along with other profile keys that have been successfully saved.

Step 3.2. Add address to business user profile

Once basic business profile information has been saved, you also need to add address information to business user profile. 
This can be done exactly the same way as we did for personal profile. Please see description under Step 2.2 above.



## User payment flow

To setup user payment flow you need these building blocks:

* [Refresh user access token](#bank-integrations-guide-refresh-user-access-token)
* [Create quote](#bank-integrations-guide-create-quote)
* [Create recipient account](#bank-integrations-guide-create-recipient-account)
* [Create transfer](#bank-integrations-guide-create-transfer)
* [Fund transfer](#bank-integrations-guide-fund-customer-transfer)



## Create quote
Please look at [Create quote](#quotes-create) under Full API Reference.

You need to set quote type as "REGULAR".



## Create recipient account
Please look at [Create recipient account](#recipient-accounts-create) under Full API Reference.


## Create transfer
Please look at [Create transfer](#transfers-create) under Full API Reference.

 
## Fund customer transfer 
Once you have successfully created transfer order via Transferwise API 
you can now debit the exact source amount from your customer's bank account 
and send funds to TransferWise local bank account via domestic payment.

In order for us to link this incoming domestic payment with corresponding transfer order, we need you to use specific text in the "payment reference" field.
Calling endpoint [Get pay-in methods](#quotes-get-pay-in-methods) with quoteId returns you the correct reference text. 
 
 
## Get transfer delivery time
Please look at [Get transfer delivery time](#borderless-payouts-guide-get-transfer-delivery-time) under Borderless Payouts Guide.


## Track transfer status
Please look at [Track transfer status](#borderless-payouts-guide-track-transfer-status) under Borderless Payouts Guide.


## Going live checklist
### 1. Make your integration bulletproof
  * Implement basic retry mechanism to handle potential failures or network interruptions 
  * Implement duplicate prevention mechanism to avoid duplicate payments. Verify that UUID is uniquely generated for each individual payment and its value is kept same in case of retrying.
  * Implement basic logging to help out in debugging and problem solving, if needed.
  * Check that you can handle all possible transfer states during polling of transfer info.
  * Required data fields for user profile addresses, recipients and transfers vary for different currencies. Please explore [Recipient Accounts.Requirements](#recipient-accounts-requirements), [Transfers.Requirements](#transfer-requirements) and [Addresses.Requirements](##addresses-requirements).

### 2. Setup security for LIVE environment
  * We have received and successfully decrypted Live API credentials.
  * Ensure access tokens and refresh tokens are stored securely and only exposed to authorized persons. 
  * Make sure your server has TLS version 1.2 or higher.
  * Implement a mechanism to obtain new access token upon expiration.
  
### 3. Do penny testing in LIVE
  * Launch LIVE integration to limit set of your customers and test all currency routes end-to-end. 
  * Test successful flow and bounce back flow. 
  * All set. Switch it on.
