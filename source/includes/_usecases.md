## Banks
Our Bank Product enables banks to build TransferWise payments seamlessly into their own desktop and mobile apps. 
Banks can build their own native user experience directly on our API, co-branded with TransferWise.

**Why should my bank do it?**

* Provide your customers faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to traditional SWIFT alternatives.
* Offer fair and transparent pricing at the mid-market exchange rate.
* Reduce your operational costs of cross-border payments.
* Stop losing out on cross-border revenues because your customers are finding better alternatives.

**How does it work?**
<ul>
  <li>Transparent and fair pricing. Customers will get the same price no matter if they make transfers via your bank integration or directly via TransferWise.</li> 
  <li>Revenue sharing. We will setup revenue sharing to make each partnership a win-win deal.</li>
  <li>Custom solution. We will work together to find a solution that works for your bank. There is no one size fits all approach. Topics we need to work out together are:
    <ul>
      <li>How do we set up flow of funds? </li>
      <li>How do we handle customer support?</li>
      <li>How do we harmonize customer onboarding and AML processes? </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
</ul>

## Connected Applications
Connected Applications gives you the ability to let users connect their TransferWise accounts to your product. Whether it’s automated reconciliation for customers in accounting software, pushing customer’s payroll runs straight into TransferWise or building on our borderless account functionality.
Unfortunately this functionality isn’t generally available yet but we are working to open it to everyone. To discuss your use case please contact contact bizdev@transferwise.com for more info.




## Third-Party Payouts
Third-Party Payouts is a product for marketplaces and financial institutions (banks and payment service providers).
It is different from Borderless Payouts since it does not require our customer to also be the originator of payments. 
So TransferWise will act as a third-party to the person who initiated the payment.  

We are working on making this feature available soon. Please contact bizdev@transferwise.com for more info.  



## Receive Money
You can receive money to the local bank details that come with your Borderless Account (AUD, EUR, GBP and USD) and reconcile these incoming payments via the API. 
 
We do not currently offer the option to build TransferWise into your checkout flow as a payment option to receive money as a merchant or any other request or receive money flows. Note though that TransferWise can be added as a payout option on your site for beneficiaries to choose to receive their payout through (to email or straight to bank account).
