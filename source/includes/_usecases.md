## Banks
Bank Product enables banks to build TransferWise payments seamlessly into their own desktop and mobile apps. 
Banks can build their own native user experience and use TransferWise API only in the background.

**Why should my bank do it?**

* Provide your customers faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to traditional SWIFT alternatives.
* Offer fair and transparent pricing at the mid-market exchange rate.
* Reduce your operational costs of cross-border payments.
* Stop losing out on cross-border revenues because your customers are finding better alternatives.

**How does it work?**
<ul>
  <li>Transparent and fair pricing. Customers will get the same price no matter if they make transfers via your bank integration or directly via TransferWise.</li> 
  <li>Revenue sharing. We will setup revenue sharing to make each partnership a win-win deal.</li>
  <li>Custom solution. We will work together to find a solution that works for your bank. There is no one size fits all approach. Topics we need to work out together include are:
    <ul>
      <li>How do we set up flow of funds? </li>
      <li>How do we handle customer support?</li>
      <li>How do we harmonize customer onboarding and AML processes? </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
</ul>

## Connected Applications
Connected Applications means the possibility to embed TransferWise product into your own application 
so that your customers will enjoy the benefits of transparent and low cost international transfers. 

Unfortunately today we have capacity to support only few such integrations. We are working on making this feature available for everyone.  

Please contact api@transferwise.com for more info.  




## Third-Party Payouts
Third-Party Payouts is a product for marketplaces and financial institutions (banks and payment service providers).
It is different from Borderless Payouts since it does not require our customer to also be the originator of payments. 
So TransferWise will act as third party to the person who initiated the payment.  

We are working on making this feature available soon. Please contact stuart.gregory@transferwise.com for more info.
